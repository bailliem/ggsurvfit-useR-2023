# KMunicate and themes

## Why?

::: {.smaller}

To get figures that align with the guidelines outlined in “Proposals on Kaplan–Meier plots in medical research and a survey of stakeholder views: KMunicate.”, use the `theme_ggsurvfit_KMunicate()` theme along with these function options.

What are the elements of an effective and publishable KM plot? 

* Do we really need to throw in the kitchen sink?

* There are many guidance available

* (Morris et al. 2018)[https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/9/e030215] provide useful guidance for publication figures

## KMunicate

```{r}
survfit2(Surv(time, status) ~ surg, data = df_colon) %>%
  ggsurvfit(linetype_aes = TRUE) +
  add_confidence_interval() +
  add_risktable(
    risktable_stats = c("n.risk", "cum.censor", "cum.event")
  ) +
  theme_ggsurvfit_KMunicate() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.02, 0)) +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.85))
```

## Design for your purpose 

* One size does not fit all

* Designing means you need to think carefully about aims and audience
