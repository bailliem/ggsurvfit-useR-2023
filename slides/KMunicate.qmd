# KMunicate and themes

## What are the elements of an effective and publishable KM plot? 

::: {.smaller}

There are many options to consider. 

There are many guidances available, [Morris et al. 2018](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/9/e030215) provide useful guidance for publication figures

To get figures that align with the guidelines outlined in “Proposals on Kaplan–Meier plots in medical research and a survey of stakeholder views: KMunicate.”, use the `theme_ggsurvfit_KMunicate()` theme along with these function options.

A note of caution on standards. 

* Design for your purpose, one size does not fit all

* Designing means you need to think carefully about your [audience and aims](http://graphicsprinciples.github.io/)
